JSONAPI is a specification that provides a standardized structure for response data as well as a predefined system for filtering/querying that data. It's extremely robust but it's also very opinionated and requires us to follow conventions put in place by its authors which sometimes may prevent us from implementing desired functionality if the specification doesn't support said functionality. In cases where the application needs extensive filtering, sorting, paging, and querying across multiple different entity types that contain relationships to one another, it can be extremely beneficial. REST Views provide a much more basic approach and allow us to configure an API the same way we would an actual View in Drupal. In smaller applications REST Views can save time as the response structure is much more straightforward than what JSONAPI provides."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["In WordPress, we typically use the built-in ",(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/",children:"WordPress REST API"}),".

The amount of time saved by using a Drupal View over a custom one depends largely upon the task at hand but for something like a basic news feed with querying and minimal sorting/filtering, it could take around five times as long to build the view custom. As complexity grows, so does the difference in time between the two approaches. Things like state management, paging, and fetching results take considerable amounts of time to implement from scratch and are all provided for free when using custom views.

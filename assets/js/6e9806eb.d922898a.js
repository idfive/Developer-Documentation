For instance, in Drupal you might have a Basic Page Content Type that includes a "Body" WYSIWYG field for the main page content as well as a "Widgets" field for adding components like accordions, blockquotes, etc. to round out the page. In T4 though, the "Body" field would be a distinct Content Type containing a WYSIWYG field and then each widget would be its own Content Type as well.

In many cases this single layout will be sufficient but in more complex cases you may need to display content in different ways based on context (I.E. a news article displayed as a teaser versus the full article output).

all honesty, fickle, challenging, and labor-intensive. When we say \\"content migration\\", we mean a transfer of existing content from an old site to a new one, and/or actually building different pages on the site from Copy Docs. This also usually happens at the same time as a CMS upgrade, as well as content restructuring. For the purposes of this document, we are focusing on what can, or cannot be automated for those migrations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"general/design/custom-views":{"id":"general/design/custom-views","title":"Custom Views","description":"In cases where design requires a view that\'s too customized compared to what we get out of the box from Drupal or WordPress, we\'re required to go the route of building something completely custom using a JS framework like Vue.js. Vue.js and similar frameworks afford us with the ability to structure the markup to match the design precisely which is ideal from a frontend standpoint. However, this comes at the cost of time as the custom approach requires significantly more work to build the view than if we were to use a view provided by the CMS. In certain cases though, functionality is required that these CMS-provided views simply can\'t provide and we have no choice but to take the custom approach.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"general/design/templating":{"id":"general/design/templating","title":"Template design and integration at idfive","description":"For better or worse, the term \\"templates\\" can have a few different meanings here. New business tends to scope/sell things as a \\"number of templates\\" in order to kind of frame the scope of the project, and to make an estimation. Those numbers do not usually, however, directly correlate to templates on the backend, more so, it is usually the number of wireframes the client will receive.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"general/design/views":{"id":"general/design/views","title":"Views Implementation","description":"When we mention a \\"view\\" we are referring to an organized filterable list of content. This may include a simple search bar or additional filters based on fields associated with the entity being listed. Depending on requirements, a view can quickly go from a quick hit task to a task that takes several days to fully implement. Each framework (drupal/wordpress) have different approaches to handling views. In the following sections we\'ll cover how views are typically managed in projects and when we\'ll need a more custom alternative solution.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"general/documentation/buddy-pipeline":{"id":"general/documentation/buddy-pipeline","title":"Buddy Pipeline Setup","description":"We use the app Buddy to deploy code to our staging server.

This in itself can be hard to understand sometimes, as many things will probably be a bit undefined. It is often required, for the dev team to prod taskers, in order to provide more clarity of the request, or for details needed in order to provide an estimate.

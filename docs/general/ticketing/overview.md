# Support Ticketing

## Ticketing tips

### Good tickets are

- Reproducible
- Limited in scope to the issue at hand
- Informational

I.e., someone unfamiliar with the project can ascertain the issue you are having, or the feature you desire.

### Good tickets contain

- Links and error messages
- Relevant corresponding files, including: screenshots, design mockups, SOW, etc.
- Steps to replicate the issue
- Potential fixes to resolve it

## Before creating a ticket

### Ask yourself

- Does the request, as it came from the client, make sense to me?
- Is the client actively participating in this discussion?
- Is there a clear ask, or do we need to refine?
- Can I recreate the issue?
- Are there related tickets? OR
- Has this come up before?
- What are the budget / timeline constraints?

### Does the developer

- Need time to set up local environments or get familiar with the project?
- Have the access needed to assess the issue? (Servers, Valid Passwords in Vault)
- Have the access needed to fix the issue? (UMD, JHU, Howard University, etc.)

## Before starting a ticket

### Ask yourself

- Do I have the information, tools, context and access I need?
- Are there any older tickets related to this issue?
- Is this a bug or a feature request?
- Is there a better solution to the problem? a.k.a., What really is the problem here?

## Tickets may inspire

- Discussions about IA and Design
- Widgets, Layout Updates
- Larger implications on the site environment APIs, Styles and Themes
- Alterations to legacy sites

## Before a ticket is considered ready for QC

### Ask yourself

- What is the QC, approval and deployment process for this project?
- Does the client need to review and approve an update?
- Have I included a link for stakeholders (PMs/clients/designers) to view the fix?
- Are the caches cleared?
- What else needs to run in order to see the updates?
- Do I need to provide further context on how to review the update?
- Have I created Test content that needs to be deleted later?

### Have I documented

- The fix I enacted, in broad strokes, so another developer: Understands what is going on? Can modify it later, pick up the ticket, etc.? The full breadth of the issue and fix, in case it comes up again?
- Next steps to get this to production?

## Before a ticket is closed

### Ask yourself

- Have I billed this time to the proper project?
- Have I closed any hotfix branches, deleted any irrelevant tests, etc.?
- Has the client been alerted, and signed off on the task?
- Does this ticket have any future implications that need to be addressed?

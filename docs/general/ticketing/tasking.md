# Tasking the Development Team

Generally, we consider taskings to be smaller tasks, not full projects, and do not require a full blown project brief. However, there still needs to be a tasking completed to the individual team member to complete what is required. This becomes extremely important when shuffling resources into projects they are not familiar with.

## Tasker (PM/AE/Etc.)

### Good taskings are

- Succinct
- Informational
- Limited in scope to the issue at hand

I.e., someone unfamiliar with the project can ascertain the issue you are having, or the feature you desire.

### Good taskings contain

- Context. Who is this client, where do I bill this, what are the relevant details as they relate to this task.
- Links. Relevant corresponding files, including: screenshots, design mockups, SOW, pages on site, etc.
- Clear Direction. When a developer tells you "this tasking is complete", what do you expect will have happened.

### Before tasking a developer

#### Ask yourself

- Do I have a clear idea of the desired outcome, and have I stated that?
- Does the developer need time to set up local environments or onboard with the project?
- Does the developer have the *access* needed to **assess** the issue?
- Does the developer have the *context* needed to **assess** the issue?
- Does the developer have the *access* needed to **fix** the issue?
- Does the developer have the *context* needed to **fix** the issue?
- Are there any related tickets/issues to be aware of?
- What are the budget / timeline constraints, if any?
- Have I provided information related to if client is reviewing/etc?
- Have I clearly defined any next steps?

#### Follow through

- Create succinct email or trello/bugify ticket, as makes sense for task.
- Address all needed points from above.

##### Example tasking

- **Client**: Client Name
- **Billing code**: XXX-XXX-XXX
- **Access**: Clients site is on pantheon, you should have access.
- **Context**: [Team Member] is out today, and need assistance with a priority request for Client before they send out a priority communication. I know you have not worked on this site/project before, please take time to spin up local version of site, and look into below issue.
- **Task**: There is a small mistake in the header styles, as seen [link to page]. Styles should reflect final approved design, seen here [link to flat]. Since this is a minor change, client expressed they do not wish to take time to approve on dev/stg before going to production. Please push to production once complete, and confirm fix.
- **Next steps**: Notify [Team Member], who will then alert client.

## Taskee (Dev Team)

### Ask yourself

- Do I have the information, tools, context and access I need?
- Are there any older tickets/communications related to this issue?
- Do I feel I have clear direction?
- Do I have enough to get started?

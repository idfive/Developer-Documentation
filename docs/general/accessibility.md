# Accessibility at idfive

## Our Commitment to Accessibility

At idfive, accessibility isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's a foundational principle that guides every project we undertake. We believe the web should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability, technology, or circumstance. This commitment extends beyond compliance; it's about creating inclusive digital experiences that serve all users effectively.

## Standards We Follow

### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance

All idfive projects adhere to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) standards, the most current internationally recognized guidelines for web accessibility. These comprehensive standards ensure our digital products are:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

#### Key WCAG 2.2 Enhancements

WCAG 2.2 includes important new success criteria that address modern accessibility needs:

- **Focus Not Obscured**: Ensures focused elements remain visible and not hidden by other content
- **Dragging Movements**: Provides alternatives to drag-and-drop interactions for users with motor impairments
- **Target Size**: Requires minimum touch target sizes for mobile and touch interfaces
- **Consistent Help**: Ensures help mechanisms appear in consistent locations across pages
- **Redundant Entry**: Reduces cognitive load by avoiding unnecessary re-entry of information
- **Accessible Authentication**: Provides alternatives to cognitive function tests in authentication processes

### Additional Standards

- **WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: We implement ARIA attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and complex UI components
- **Section 508**: For government and public sector clients, we ensure compliance with federal accessibility requirements
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**: Our designs support legal compliance requirements for digital accessibility

## Our Accessibility Approach

### Semantic HTML Foundation

We build with semantic HTML as the cornerstone of accessibility. This means:

- Using proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to create logical document structure
- Implementing semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` for clear page structure
- Ensuring all interactive elements are properly marked up with appropriate roles and attributes

### Navigation and User Experience

#### Skip Links

Every site includes skip links that allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to main content. These are typically hidden visually but available to screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements are fully accessible via keyboard navigation using standard patterns:

- Tab order follows logical reading sequence
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- All functionality available via mouse is also available via keyboard
- Custom interactive components include proper focus management

#### Focus Management

We implement comprehensive focus management including:

- Visible focus indicators with sufficient color contrast
- Logical tab order throughout all pages
- Proper focus trapping in modal dialogs and overlays
- Focus restoration when closing modal elements
- Focus indicators that are not obscured by other content (WCAG 2.2)

#### Modern Interaction Patterns

- Consistent help mechanisms positioned in the same relative location across pages
- Alternative methods for drag-and-drop interactions
- Single-pointer alternatives for multi-point or path-based gestures
- Authentication processes that don't rely solely on cognitive function tests

### Visual Design Accessibility

#### Color and Contrast

- All text meets WCAG 2.2 AA color contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Non-text elements like icons, form inputs, and interactive components meet 3:1 contrast ratio requirements
- Information is never conveyed through color alone
- Interactive elements have clear visual states (hover, focus, active)

#### Typography and Readability

- Font sizes are scalable and responsive
- Line height and spacing optimized for readability
- Text can be zoomed to 200% without loss of functionality
- Text spacing can be adjusted without loss of content or functionality

#### Touch and Interaction Design

- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (24x24 CSS pixels for WCAG 2.2)
- Drag-and-drop functionality includes alternative interaction methods
- Gesture-based controls provide single-pointer alternatives
- Motion-triggered actions can be disabled when not essential

### Images and Media

#### Alternative Text

- All informational images include descriptive alternative text
- Decorative images are properly marked to be ignored by screen readers
- Complex images (charts, graphs) include detailed descriptions when necessary

#### Media Accessibility

- Video content includes accurate captions and transcripts when applicable
- Audio content provides transcripts or alternative formats
- Autoplay media is avoided or includes user controls

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing Tools

We use industry-leading automated testing tools to catch accessibility issues early:

#### Browser Extensions and Dev Tools

- **aXe DevTools**: Chrome extension for comprehensive accessibility auditing
- **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)**: Real-time accessibility feedback
- **Lighthouse Accessibility Audit**: Built into Chrome DevTools for performance and accessibility scoring

#### Continuous Monitoring

- **SiteImprove**: Enterprise-level accessibility monitoring for ongoing compliance
- **W3C Markup Validator**: Ensures semantic HTML compliance

### Manual Testing Process

Automated tools catch many issues, but human testing is essential:

#### Screen Reader Testing

- **NVDA (Windows)**: Free, widely-used screen reader for comprehensive testing
- **JAWS**: Industry-standard screen reader for enterprise testing
- **VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)**: Apple's built-in screen reader for cross-platform testing

#### Keyboard Navigation Testing

- Complete site navigation using only keyboard input
- Testing all interactive elements and form controls
- Verifying proper focus management and visual indicators

#### Browser and Device Testing

- Testing across multiple browsers and devices
- Verifying functionality at various zoom levels
- Ensuring responsive design maintains accessibility

### Client-Specific Requirements

We understand that many organizations have their own accessibility testing protocols and compliance requirements. We work closely with client accessibility teams to ensure our deliverables meet specific organizational standards:

#### In-House Compliance Teams

- **University compliance departments** with specific testing protocols
- **Corporate accessibility teams** with custom evaluation criteria
- **Government agencies** with specialized Section 508 requirements
- **Healthcare organizations** with additional privacy and accessibility considerations

#### Custom Testing Accommodation

We can adapt our development and testing processes to align with client-specific requirements when provided with:

- **Custom accessibility checklists** or evaluation criteria
- **Specific testing tools** preferred by the organization
- **Internal accessibility standards** that exceed or supplement WCAG guidelines
- **Specialized user testing protocols** involving the organization's user base

**Important Note**: To ensure seamless integration with client accessibility requirements, these specifications should be provided during project planning phases. This allows us to incorporate custom testing protocols into our development workflow and avoid remediation delays.

- Semantic markup enhances SEO and site performance
- Keyboard accessibility supports power users and alternative input devices

### Legal and Business Compliance

Beyond doing the right thing, accessibility compliance:

- Reduces legal risk and potential ADA litigation
- Expands market reach to include users with disabilities
- Demonstrates commitment to diversity and inclusion
- Often improves overall user experience and satisfaction

### SEO and Performance Benefits

Accessible websites typically perform better in search engines because:

- Semantic HTML is easier for search engines to understand
- Fast loading times (required for accessibility) improve search rankings
- Clear heading structures help search engines index content
- Alternative text provides additional content for search indexing

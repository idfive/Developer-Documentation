# Schema.org Structured Data

## What is Schema.org?

Schema.org is a collaborative vocabulary for structured data markup that helps search engines, AI systems, and other machines understand the content and context of web pages. Created by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex, it provides a standardized way to describe entities, relationships, and actions on the web.

## Why Schema.org Matters

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Schema markup significantly enhances how search engines understand and display your content:

#### Rich Results & Featured Snippets

- Enhanced search listings with star ratings, prices, availability
- Recipe cards with cooking times, ingredients, and nutrition info
- Event listings with dates, locations, and ticket information
- FAQ sections that appear directly in search results
- Breadcrumb navigation in search results

#### Better Content Understanding

- Helps search engines distinguish between different types of content
- Clarifies relationships between entities (people, places, organizations)
- Reduces ambiguity in content interpretation
- Improves relevance scoring for search queries

#### Local SEO Benefits

- Enhanced local business listings with hours, contact info, reviews
- Improved Google My Business integration

3. **Implement Progressively** - Begin with key pages, expand gradually
4. **Monitor Performance** - Use Google Search Console and testing tools
5. **Stay Updated** - Schema.org vocabulary evolves regularly

### Quality Guidelines

- **Be Accurate** - Only markup content that's visible on the page
- **Be Specific** - Use the most specific schema type available
- **Be Complete** - Include required properties and recommended ones
- **Be Consistent** - Maintain consistent markup patterns across the site
- **Be Validated** - Always test markup before deployment

## General Training Overview

While these vary by client, below is a simple start to a basic CMS training for a client. This will obviously need to be added to/modified for more complex sites.

This is a general outline. Specifics can be tailored to, to better serve the audince in say an hour long training.

There are three initial questions to ask, if we are to further tailor training:

- Who, are we training.
- What is their current skillset, in the chosen CMS.
- What are their day to day roles in the site, ie, what do they do the most, day to day, in the site.

# Performance

Keep performance in mind as you start building out a project. It will be much easier to keep this in mind throughout instead of right before launch. For more insights into idfive's philosophy on performance, see [our related blog post](https://idfive.com/agency/insights/website-speed-testing-seo-vs-ux/).

## Tips
- Image optimization: Ensure that images are sized appropriatelyâ€”not too large, but not so small that the resolution is poor. Most modern CMS systems have tools and extensions to optimize image assets during publishing. 
- Minifying CSS and Javascript: Reduce unnecessary characters (spaces, line breaks, etc.) from CSS and Javascript files to reduce the overall file size, allowing these crucial aspects of a site to load faster.
- Optimize Caching: Apply server-side optimization strategies, including component and page-level caching to greatly improve a PageSpeed score.
- Lazy loading: Now that this can be done natively and with relative ease in the browser, set non-critical images to load only when needed (aka scrolled to in the viewport), allowing the page to load much faster.
- Reduce third-party code: Do not add too many trackers to your site, as they slow the load time. Some are critical (like Analytics), but adding too many extraneous scripts can quickly slow things down.


## Testing
[Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) can be used to obtain a performance score. The score is broken down into "mobile" and "desktop".

# Pattern Lab Starter (formerly ICL)

The Pattern Lab Starter is a collection of components to be used to begin new front-end development projects.

## Download

To download the starter [visit the Bitbucket Repo Downloads - Tags](https://bitbucket.org/idfivellc/idfive-pattern-lab-starter/downloads/?tab=tags) and under "Download", select a zip file of the latest tag. Downloading this way as opposed to cloning the repo will remove the git tracking (so it can be connected to the new project) and ensure that the latest intended version is pulled (new versions tagged when ready for production).

## Installation

`nvm use`

`npm install`

`npm run develop`

This will open the "Welcome page"

# ICL (idfive Component Library)

**A collection of components to be used to begin new front-end development projects.** This library is synced-up manually to the [Drupal Accelerator](https://dev-idfive-drupal-accelerator.pantheonsite.io/) and to the [Wordpress Accelerator](https://dev-idfive-accelerator.pantheonsite.io/) sites.

## Staging Site

The library can be viewed on our [Netlify site](https://idfive-component-library.netlify.app/).

## Download A Copy

To download the starter [visit the Bitbucket Repo Downloads - Tags](https://bitbucket.org/idfivellc/idfive-pattern-lab-starter/downloads/?tab=tags) and under "Download", select a zip file of the latest tag. Downloading this way as opposed to cloning the repo will remove the git tracking (so it can be connected to the new project) and ensure that the latest intended version is pulled (new versions tagged when ready for production).

## Installation

Node.js is the backbone of our frontend build process. Node Version Manager (NVM) is used to manage versioning [(install instructions from GitHub)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating):

- [Version 20.19.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.19.0) is the latest version used with the Astro version of the ICL
- [Version 19.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v19.0.0) is used for last version of the Pattern Lab Starter (all Pattern Lab projects)
- [Version 12.20.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.20.0) Is used for most older Fractal projects

**In a terminal window at the root of the ICL - run the following commands:**

<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    - `nvm use` 
    - `npm install` 
    - `npm run dev`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version 2+ (Vite/PostCSS)">
    - `nvm use` 
    - `npm install` 
    - `npm run develop`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v1.0" label="ICL Version < 2 (SCSS)">
    - `nvm use` 
    - `npm install` 
    - `npm run fractal`
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will open the "Welcome page", changes made in code will automatically be refreshed/reflected in the browser.

## Interface

<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    The ICL Pages and Component list is on the left side of the page:
    - **Components** is a list of all available components - not in a page context
    - **Pages** contains fully built out pages, this is typically where review occurs (opens in new tabs)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version < 3 (Pattern Lab)">
    The ICL Pages and Component list is typically on the left side of the page (it can be moved to the top by selecting "switch layout", but the left side is the default):
    - **Components** is a list of all available components - not in a page context
    - **Pages** contains fully built out pages, this is typically where review occurs
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
## Build

<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    - Run `npm run build`  
    - To preview the build (`/dist` directory) run `npm run preview`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version 2+ (Vite/PostCSS)">
    **No build step is needed** - the js and css are being built and optimized continuously. 
    - Run `npm run develop` 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="v1.0" label="ICL Version < 2 (SCSS)">
    **To build for production**, ensure that `npm run develop` has been run initially to build the sass files. JS is minified using [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser). CSS is minified using [minify](https://github.com/coderaiser/minify):
    - `npm run build:all`
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Folder Structure

<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    - **dist** is the build folder, the static assets and pages are re-created here when `npm run build` is run
    - **public** static folder where images and favicons (any assets needed) can be placed and accessed as needed
    - **src**:
      - **assets**:
        - **CSS** contains css partial files, compiled into `index.css` (see [css documentation](/docs/front-end/css) for more information)
        - **JS** contains all typescript modules:
          - **components** contains individual modules for respective components (when required for functionality)
          - **utilities** contains helpful accessibility functions that can be used to simply certain tasks
          - **main.ts** imports all functions and calls init functions for each (this file gets compiled into one on build)
      - **components** contains the `.astro` source files for components
      - **data**:
        - **global.json** data for use throughout site that will not change, for example the site header and site footer data
        - ***.json** data used for all pages of the site, as well as variations on pages (see kitchen sink or home for example)
      - **icl-utils** contains utility scripts for ICL usage, not to intended to be edited unless absolutely needed
      - **layouts/Layout.astro** the main page structure layout that is used on every page of the site
      - **pages** contains the `.astro` source files for pages. The files in the `/components` subdirectory are solely for display in the ICL Pages/Component list view only and not intended to be edited
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version 2+ (Vite/PostCSS)">
    - **Annotations** is not in use, but can be used as an alternate way of documenting components (insead of placing the documentation in the respective component folder)
    - **Data** contains global data, currently the starter library consists of `data.json` which holds data for global components such as the site-header and site-footer (this prevents the data from needing to be repeated for multiple instances). This can be re-organized/customized to suit developer needs
    - **Meta** contains the header and footer code that gets applied to all patterns and pages. `_head.twig` contains all of the html and header starting code and `_foot.twig` for footer and ending html code/tags - more info can be found [here](https://patternlab.io/docs/modifying-the-pattern-header-and-footer/)
    - **Patterns** contains the bulk of the code in use (components, core & pages). The three directories in here correlate to what is seen in the browser interface and are documented [above](idfive-component-library#interface)
    - **CSS** contains css partial files, compiled into `index.css` (see [css documentation](/docs/front-end/css) for more information)
    - **Fonts** is empty by default (Google Fonts are linked to in `_head.twig` for the sarter version), but local fonts can be added to this directory
    - **Images** contains all starter images, as well as icons and svgs
    - **JS** contains all typescript modules:
      - **components** contains individual modules for respective components (when required for functionality)
      - **utilities** contains helpful accessibility functions that can be used to simply certain tasks
      - **main.ts** imports all functions and calls init functions for each (this file gets compiled into one on build)

## Data

### Component Data

<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    Data on the component level is structured in stored in the same directory as the component's `.astro` file. For example, the button-set component's astro template:
    ```jsx title="src/components/button-link-set/Button-Link-Set.astro"
      ---
      const { buttonLinkSet } = Astro.props;
      // highlight-next-line
      import data from './button-link-set.json';
      const buttonLinkSetData = buttonLinkSet || data.button_link_set;
      import Button from '../button/Button.astro';
      import PrimaryLink from '../primary-link/Primary-Link.astro';
      ---

      <div class="button-link-set">
        <ul>
          {buttonLinkSetData.type === "button" ? (
            buttonLinkSetData.items.map((button: any) => (
              <li>
                <Button button={button.button} />
              </li>
            ))
          ) : buttonLinkSetData.type === "link" ? (
            buttonLinkSetData.items.map((link: any) => (
              <li>
                <PrimaryLink primaryLink={link.primary_link || link.button} />
              </li>
            ))
          ) : null}
        </ul>
      </div>
    ```
    **Note:** as seen in the example, components can be nested within other components

    The corresponding component data can be found in json file in the same directory at `./button-link-set.json`, called in the line `import data from './button-link-set.json';`

    ```json title="src/components/button-link-set/button-link-set.json"
    {
      "button_set": {
        "buttons": [
          {
            "button": {
              "text": "Button One",
              "url": "https://idfive.com/"
            }
          }
          // rest of json data
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    The json data object should be named similarly to the component ("button_set" in this case), in order to call it properly when included on a page.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version < 3 (Pattern Lab)">
    Data on the component level is structured in stored in the same directory as the component's `twig` file. For example, the button-set component's twig template (at `source/_patterns/components/buttons-links/button-set.twig`):

    ```html
    <div class="button-set">
      <ul>
        {% for button in button_set.buttons %}
        <li>{% include "@components/buttons-links/button.twig" with button %}</li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </div>
    ```

    **Note:** as seen in the example, components can be nested within other components

    The corresponding component data can be found in json file in the same directory at `source/_patterns/components/buttons-links/button-set.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "button_set": {
        "buttons": [
          {
            "button": {
              "text": "Button One",
              "url": "https://idfive.com/"
            }
          }
          // rest of json data
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    The json data object should be named similarly to the component ("button_set" in this case), in order to call it properly when included on a page.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Page Data

<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    Each page has a corresponding json file. The Kitchen Sink page (`src/pages/[kitchenSink].astro`) data is in the same directory (`src/data/kitchen-sink/kitchen-sink.json`). The json file starts with:
    ```json title="src/data/kitchen-sink/kitchen-sink.json"
    {
      "title": "Kitchen Sink",
    // rest of json data
    ```

    - The title corresponds to the `<title>` attribute

    #### Including Components on a Page With Unique Data
    - To include a component on a page the syntax is `<ComponentName componentName={data.page_component_name.component_name}></ComponentName>`
    - For example - calling the button-set component:
    ```jsx
    <ButtonLinkSet buttonLinkSet={data.kitchen_sink_button_set.button_link_set}></ButtonLinkSet>
    ```
    - The `with` portion allows for a unique instances of the data (so that multiple instances can be called with different data), give it a logical name (it can be the same name as the component itself - but depending on the context can be confusing)
    - In the Kitchen Sink json file, this would appear as:

    ```json title="src/data/kitchen-sink/kitchen-sink.json"
    {
      "title": "Kitchen Sink",
      //  other json data
      "kitchen_sink_button_set": {
        "button_set": {
          "buttons": [
            {
              "button": {
                "text": "Button One",
                "url": "https://idfive.com/"
              }
            },
            {
              "button": {
                "text": "Button Two",
                "url": "https://idfive.com/"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
      // rest of json data
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version < 3 (Pattern Lab)">
    Each page has a corresponding json file. The Kitchen Sink page (`source/_patterns/pages/kitchen-sink.twig`) data is in the same directory (`source/_patterns/pages/kitchen-sink.json`). The json file starts with:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Kitchen Sink",
    // rest of json data
    ```

    - The title corresponds to the `<title>` attribute

    #### Including Components on a Page With Unique Data

    - To include a component on a page the syntax is `{% include "@path-to-component" with name_of_data %}`
    - For example - calling the button-set component:

    ```html
    {% include "@components/buttons-links/button-set.twig" with
    kitchen_sink_button_set %}
    ```

    - The `with` portion allows for a unique instances of the data (so that multiple instances can be called with different data), give it a logical name (it can be the same name as the component itself - but depending on the context can be confusing)
    - In the Kitchen Sink json file, this would appear as:

    ```json
    {
      "title": "Kitchen Sink",
      //  other json data
      "kitchen_sink_button_set": {
        "button_set": {
          "buttons": [
            {
              "button": {
                "text": "Button One",
                "url": "https://idfive.com/"
              }
            },
            {
              "button": {
                "text": "Button Two",
                "url": "https://idfive.com/"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
      // rest of json data
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Variants (Page & Component)
<Tabs groupId="icl-versions">
  <TabItem value="v3.0" label="ICL Version 3+ (Astro)">
    **Currently only page variations are supported. Component variations may become supported at a later time.**

    In order for an Astro page to support variations, the page name must be contained in brackets []. For example, the Kitchen Sink page is called `[kitchenSink].astro`. In the front matter (at the top of the template between the `---` and closing `---`), the following code is used to support and create variations:
    ```jsx title="/src/pages/[examplePageName].astro"
      // import the deep merge utility to merge json files
      import { deepMerge } from '../icl-utils';

      export async function getStaticPaths() {
        
        // Import JSON files
        const pageNameData = await import('../data/page-name/page-name.json');
        const pageNameVariationData = await import('../data/page-name/page-name-variation.json');
        
        // Use the first declared data as the default/base data
        const defaultData = pageNameData.default;

        return [
          // First page uses full default data
          // in this example the urls created be /page-name and /page-name-variation
          { params: { pageName: 'page-name' }, props: { data: defaultData } },
          
          // Other pages deep merge default with their overrides
          { params: { pageName: 'page-name-variation' }, props: { 
            data: deepMerge(defaultData, kitchenSinkWithSubnavData.default) 
          }}
        ];
      }

      // Save the merged data for use with components on page 
      // for example the "data." here: <ComponentName componentName={data.page_component_name.component_name} />
      const { data } = Astro.props;
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="v2.0" label="ICL Version < 3 (Pattern Lab)">
    Pages and components can have variants displayed without duplicating the twig file. This concept is referred to as a psuedo-pattern in the [Pattern Lab documentation](https://patternlab.io/docs/using-pseudo-patterns/). The syntax is:

    ```html
    patternName~pseudo-pattern-name.json
    ```

    An example in our library is the hero at `source/_patterns/components/hero/hero.twig`, which has variations (with and without image, with and without subnav, and all combinations). The hero json file outputs a subnav if it is present - so to output this in Pattern Lab a json file called `hero~no-subnav.json` is created in the same directory at `source/_patterns/components/hero/hero~no-subnav.json`, with an empty subnav:

    ```json
    {
      "hero": {
        "title": "Hero Title - No Subnav",
        "subnav": {
          "subnav": {
            "items": []
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This can also be replicated at the page level - the Kitchen Sink pages are set up to display these hero variations using the same concept. The file `kitchen-sink~hero-no-image.json` contains:

    ```json
    {
      "kitchen_sink_hero": {
        "hero": {
          "title": "Hero Title - No Image",
          "image": {
            "desktop_src": "",
            "mobile_src": "",
            "alt": ""
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

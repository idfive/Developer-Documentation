# Overview

**A collection of components to be used to begin new front-end development projects.** This library is synced-up manually to the [Drupal Accelerator](https://dev-idfive-drupal-accelerator.pantheonsite.io/) and to the [Wordpress Accelerator](https://dev-idfive-accelerator.pantheonsite.io/) sites at the start of each project.

The Accelerator project consists of both a WordPress, and Drupal website starter template, for a quick to customize, unique website that can be completed with much less development time to put together.

The general expectation is that by using prebuilt, and pre-integrated components for each CMS, we can quickly customize and create a new website that is up to the standards of idfive.

In this manner, we are free to focus more budget on custom, unique items and functionality for clients, and rely on proven stock features where unique components are not required.

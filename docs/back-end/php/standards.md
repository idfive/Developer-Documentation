# PHP 
For PHP projects, we adopt the [PSR-2: Coding Standards](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

## Variables & Properties 
The PSR-1 & PSR-2 guides intentionally avoids any recommendation regarding the use of `$StudlyCaps`, `$camelCase`, or `$under_score` for property & variable names. For these, we use the `$under_score` convention.

## Platform/CMS specific
In general, any PHP work on a major platform like wordpess/drupal/etc should adopt, and comply with the standards set by those frameworks.

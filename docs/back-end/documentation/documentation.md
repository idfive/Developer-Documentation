# Documenting custom code, modules and themes
In general, we utilize both a README.md for each project/sub project, as well as inline documentation.

## README.md
This is the place to really outline what this project is, and does. Some CMS's, like drupal and wordpress, have their own reccomended formats, and those should be followed whenever possible.

 In general, be sure to document the following, at a minimum:

  - About: What this does, and what it is for.
  - Instalation: How is this downloaded, installed, updated, etc.
  - Configuration: Are their any special configurations required? Does it rely on anything 3rd party/etc?
  - Options: Are their any user specified options, like theme settings?
  - Development: What should future developers know about this project. How is the front end structured, what libraries/etc. What is "non standard" about this.

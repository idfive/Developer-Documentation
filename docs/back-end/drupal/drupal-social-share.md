# Drupal Social Share

## The Need

Clients often require that pages on their sites can be easily and attractively shared on social media. Developers direct the format of the shared post through the use of metatags in the code of the webpage being shared. Social media services scrape the code of the page for information to display in the share.

Each social media platform has its own way of scraping/previewing, which may potentially change at any time in the future. In general, we can simply ensure that metatags, particularly OG metatags are as optimized as possible.

## Metatags

Metatags in the page source code directs social media services how to render the shared page on social media. Facebook and LinkedIn use the [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/). Open Graph metatags have the prefix 'og.' Twitter uses it's own proprietary set of tags with the prefix 'twitter.' Twitter specifically calls shared content formats 'cards.' Open Graph prefers to say that og metatags turns webpages into open graph objects that can be used by social media services.

[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards), [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/46687/making-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin?lang=en) all provide sharing guides for developers.

Open Graph only requires the following tags for sharing:

- `og:title`
- `og:image`
- `og:description`
- `og:url`

Twitter cards work similarly, with the following as the suggested minimum tags:

- `twitter:card`
- `twitter:site`
- `twitter:description`
- `twitter:image`
- `twitter:image:alt`

The Twitter card tags are self explanatory, save for twitter:card tag and the twitter:site. Twitter:card identifies the card type to use. Twitter provides four formats to choose from for shares: [summary](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary), [summary card with large image](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image), [app card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/app-card), and [player card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/player-card). Twitter:site contains the Twitter username the card should be attributed to.

### Examples

#### Open Graph

```html
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Site Name Here" />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Page Title Here" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://MY_AWESOME_SITE/page_title_here" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Short description of page content goes here." />
<meta property="og:updated_time" content="2020-02-03T10:44:48-05:00" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://MY_AWESOME_SITE/files/field/image/SOCIAL_IMAGE.jpg" />
```

#### Twitter

```html
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@CLIENTS_TWITTER_HANDLE" />
<meta name="twitter:url" content="https://MY_AWESOME_SITE/page_title_here" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Page Title Here" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Short description of page content goes here." />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://MY_AWESOME_SITE/files/field/image/SOCIAL_IMAGE.jpg" />
```
## Image standards

[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/images/), [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image) (for Summary with Large Image card), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/70781/image-specifications-for-your-linkedin-pages-and-career-pages?lang=en) (See "Custom Image Specifications" at the bottom) all provide guidelines for image dimensions for shared posts.

Facebook:

- The minimum allowed image dimension is 200 x 200 pixels.
- The size of the image file must not exceed 8 MB.
- Use images that are at least 1200 x 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 x 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images.

Twitter:

- Images for this Card support an aspect ratio of 2:1 with minimum dimensions of 300x157 or maximum of 4096x4096 pixels.
- Images must be less than 5MB in size.
- JPG, PNG, WEBP and GIF formats are supported. Only the first frame of an animated GIF will be used. SVG is not supported.

LinkedIn:

- Use a 1.91:1 ratio (1200x627 px).
- Image must be more than 200px wide.
- If your image width is less than 200px, it will appear as a thumbnail on the left side of the post.
- Images on mobile wonâ€™t be cropped. Images of other ratios will show in full with subtle white padding.

Generally, this means that images with a 1.91:1 to a 2:1 ratio will look fine shared. Images should be between 600 and 2000 pixels wide. When defining the image in Drupal, set the maximum and minimum dimensions with explicit instructions for sizing for best use by social media platforms.

## Drupal modules

Tags can be added to webpages using the [metatag module](https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag). Versions are available for both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. The basic process for both versions is the same: entity fields are associated with tags in the metatags.

### Drupal 7

The metatag module is installed in the normal way. Metatag:OpenGraph and Metatag: Twitter Card are submodules that must be installed in addition to the main Metatag module. Configuration for the module is set at "/admin/config/search/metatags." Click on "Add Default Metatags" to config metatags for a particular type, entity, or taxonomy.

On the configuration page (for example: /admin/config/search/metatags/config/node) there are sections for Open Graph and for Twitter Card. In each section there is a list of tags that can be associated with an entity field. For example, a featured image field can be associated with the open graph image (ie: [node:field_image] ).

### Drupal 8

Only slightly different from Drupal 7, the configuration for the metatag module in Drupal 8 is at: /admin/config/search/metatag. To add a news configuration for an entity type, click on the "Add Default Metatags" button, like in the Drupal 7 module. Just as with Drupal 7, configure the Open Graph or Twitter Card sharing format by associating tags with tokens representing entity fields. [Drupal online documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/metatag/features-of-metatag-for-drupal-8) includes a full description of the module's features.

### Adding default images

Default share images can be added ina preprocess function. Add a new metatag by adding to the $variables['page']['#attached']['html_head'] array in the _template_preprocess_html_ function. The metatag is an array containing a tag type and an array of attributes containing the name and content attributes of the tag.

For example
```php

$metatag = [
    '#tag' => 'meta',
    '#attributes' => [
        'name' => 'twitter:image',
        'content' => 'https://path/img/twitterimage.jpg'
    ],
];

$variables['page']['#attached']['html_head'][] = [$metatag, "twitter:image"];
```
Preprocess html does not provide the node entity, so it has to be gotten. Then, simply make sure that the image field is empty before adding the meta tag. For example:

```php

  // Get the node
  $node = \Drupal::request()->attributes->get('node');
  if ($node) {

    // Get content type
    $type = $node->getType();

    if ($type == "TYPE TO ADD TAG" && $node->field_SOCIAL MEDIA_IMAGE_FIELD->isEmpty()) {
      $metatag = [
        '#tag' => 'meta',
        '#attributes' => [
            'name' => 'twitter:image',
            'content' => 'https://path/img/twitterimage.jpg'
        ],
      ]
      $variables['page']['#attached']['html_head'][] = [$metatag, "twitter:image"];
    }
  }
  ```

## Linters

Each service provides a page for checking and debugging shared posts.

- [Facebook Sharing Degbugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)

### _Note on current use for clients using MVC Apps_

(As of 2/20) Howard University, and several other clients rely heavily on the use of REST APIs to distribute information across associated sites. Some of these subsequent sites rely on MVC's (like angular). For Howard, for example, The newsroom, people profile, and calendar are angular apps. Articles posted on the newsroom site, for example, have an "article" URL which, through use of a rewrite rule in an .htaccess file, displays content from a "static" URL. Debugging any issues where posts seem to not display correctly should begin with looking at the .htaccess file. This isn a typical issue for MVC apps, which traditionally have required a static, or server side redirect for both search and share.

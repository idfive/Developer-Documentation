# Drupal Performance

Web applications are a combination of server-side and client-side code. To improve the web performance, both the sides need to be optimized.

**The client-side optimization** relates to the initial page load time, JavaScript that runs in the browser, downloading all of the resources etc. that are seen in the web browser.

**The server-side optimization** relates to database queries and other application dependencies to check how long it takes to run on the server for executing requests.

## General

- Uninstall all unused modules. Also remove from codebase if possible.
- Aggregate CSS/JS files.
- Enable fast 404 module
- Consider a CDN
- Consider [quicklink](https://www.drupal.org/project/quicklink) to speed up subsequent page loads.

## Caching

[Internal Page Cache](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/administering-a-drupal-8-site/internal-page-cache) module helps in caching the web pages for anonymous users to increase the speed for subsequent users.

[Dynamic Page Cache](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/dynamic-page-cache/overview) module caches web pages for the anonymous and authenticated users and is recommended for the websites of all screen sizes.

[BigPipe](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/big-pipe/overview) module allows your users to quickly see the unchanged, cacheable page elements while the personalized content is exhibited next. This technology was inspired by Facebook. Drupal 8â€™s much improved render pipeline and render API is of huge help.

### BigPipe

- consider also installing [Big Pipe sessionless](https://www.drupal.org/project/big_pipe_sessionless) to assist with non sessioned content.

## Images

- Utilize image styles.
- Consider lazy loading. The idfive ICL lazy loader module does this for newer builds.
- Use ImageApi Optimize with one of the free services.
- Consider using the responsive images module for larger images. It is a bit of setup, but can be worthwhile for mobile performance on pages with huge images.

## Drastic measures

- Consider breaking frontend css/js into modular files, and only include those libraries on needed pages.
- Consider using JS to load lists/views after page load, by interacting with jsonapi.

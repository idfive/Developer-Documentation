# idfive drupal custom API endpoint list module challenge

## Overview

A challenge for current, and potential idfive Backend developers, to assess knowledge and skills in drupal custom module creation, as well as working with third party API's.

## Requirements

Create a custom drupal 8 module that accomplishes the following:

- Interacts with [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/), to show a listing of 3 films from `https://swapi.co/api/films` in any order you desire.
- These films should display in a block, that could be enabled on any region in a stock or custom theme.
- Each individual film view should include: title, episode_id, director, producer, and release date fields at a minimum.

## Deliverables

- Link to git repository containing custom module.
- Link to site showing finished product. This can be a pantheon sandbox, or anywhere else, just need to see your block in place.

## Judgement criterea

- Any/All needed config should be within the module itself. You may manually assign the block to a region in your test site, but any field config/etc will need to be included.
- All code should conform to drupal coding standards.
- All custom functions should get a Unit test, at minimum.
- All custom code, and the module itself should be documented to standard.
- Module should be able to be enabled on any D8 site, by downloading module, enabling, and assigning the block to a region.
- No frontend styles needed, but bonus points if you do.
- Bonus points for Behavioral, or Functional tests.

## Time

We estimate this would likely take somewhere between 4-8 hours, skills dependant.

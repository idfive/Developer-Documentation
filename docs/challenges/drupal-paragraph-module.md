# idfive drupal custom paragraph module challenge

## Overview

A challenge for current, and potential idfive Backend developers, to assess knowledge and skills in drupal custom module creation, as well as working with configuration, coding, formatting, and documenting to standard. Use both this documentation site of idfive preferences, and examples, as well as any relevant drupal documentation desired to enact this module.

## Requirements

Create a custom drupal 8 module that accomplishes the following:

- Interacts with the [paragraphs](https://drupal.org/paragraphs) module, to show static content.
- The custom paragraphs entity should display an image, title, short body text, and Call to action link.
- Conforms to current drupal coding standards.
- Includes all custom configuration.
- Includes all needed documentation per drupal and idfive standards.
- Passes [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) AA level testing.
- Passes [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) testing.

## Deliverables

- Link to git repository containing the custom module only. Full commit history desired.
- Link to D8 site showing finished product. This can be a pantheon sandbox, or really anywhere else, just need to see your block in place.

## Code review criteria

- Any/All needed config should be within the module itself. You may manually fill out test content in your test site, but any field config/etc will need to be included.
- All code should conform to drupal coding standards.
- All custom code, and the module itself should be documented to standard.
- Passes [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) AA level testing.
- Passes [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) testing.
- Module should be able to be enabled on any D8 site, by downloading module, enabling, and assigning the block to a region.
- No frontend styles needed, but bonus points if you do.

## Time

We estimate this would likely take somewhere between 2-6 hours, skills dependant.

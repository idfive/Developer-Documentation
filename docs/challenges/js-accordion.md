# JS Accordion

## Overview

A challenge for current, and potential idfive Frontend developers, this assesses basic knowledge of JS fundamentals like scope and closures, design patterns, etc to create reusable, modular JS components.

## Requirements

Create a simple, reusable accordion component that accomplishes the following:

- Manages its own internal state to demonstrate understanding of scope/closures.
- Use any pattern you'd like (constructor, module, etc) but structure the component in a way that you can easily instantiate multiple accordions on a single page, each with their own contained internal state.
- Uses plain JavaScript (I.E. no frameworks/libraries like React, Vue, etc) to demonstrate foundational understanding of JavaScript as a language as well as the underlying dynamics of modern libraries/frameworks.
- Uses semantic HTML and accounts for general accessibility requirements (keyboard navigability, ARIA functionality, etc).
- Uses modular CSS (I.E. BEM, SMACSS, etc) and includes animations for sections expanding and collapsing (bonus points if you use transforms).
- Uses modern ES6 syntax and is transpiled to ES5 code that works down to IE11.
- Passes [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) AA level testing.
- Passes [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) testing.

## Deliverables

- Link to git repository containing the custom module only. Full commit history desired.
- Link to a working example on Github Pages showcasing multiple instances of the component on a single page to verify state is encapsulated on a per-component basis.

## Code review criteria

- All custom code, no NPM modules aside from build tools like Babel, Webpack, etc.
- Passes [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) AA level testing.
- Passes [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) testing.

## Time

- We estimate this would likely take somewhere between 2-3 hours depending on styling and microinteractions.
